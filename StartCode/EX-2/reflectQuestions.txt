1. Why do sub-resource routes like /journalists/:id/articles help?
=> They show clear relationships between resources, improve URL readability,
and scope data access logically, making the API easier to understand and use.

2. Pros and cons of in-memory dummy data vs real database?
Pros: Easy setup, fast, no dependencies, good for quick prototyping.
Cons: Data lost on restart, no persistence, limited querying, not scalable.

3. How to modify structure for journalist authentication to manage own articles?
=> Add auth middleware and user model, protect routes so journalists can only manage their own articles, 
and create login/register routes.

4. Challenges linking related resources (like journalistId), and solutions?
=> Ensuring referenced IDs exist without DB constraintsâ€”solve by manual checks in code.
Handling deletions carefully to avoid orphaned data.

5. How does RESTful design help frontend developers?
=> It makes the API predictable, consistent, and easy to navigate with clear URLs and HTTP methods,
simplifying frontend integration and data fetching.
